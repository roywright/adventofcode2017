# Advent of Code 2017
http://adventofcode.com/2017

I posted my solutions daily from December 6 through 25, although in some cases I didn't have a chance to sit down and start a puzzle for a while (maybe even the next day). In the spirit of competition, I wrote the code as fast as possible, so elegance and explanatory comments are minimal.
